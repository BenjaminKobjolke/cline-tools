### BEGIN GENERAL RULES

You do not refractor code by yourself.
Wait until you get clear instructions for refractoring from the user.

When the user reports a bug think about your recent changes if those could have caused the bug. Only if you are sure those are not the case or you and the user debugged those new changes properly then can you think about other resons for the bug.

If you encounter any new information that could improve the efficiency of AI assistants when working on this project, add it to the `.clinerules` file.

Ensure that the information is added to the appropriate section:
- **BEGIN SYSTEM:** Add information relevant only to the current system.
- **BEGIN Local project specific hints:** Add information specific to the current project.

Organizing information correctly ensures accurate and efficient assistance in future tasks.
